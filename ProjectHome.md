### Play videos in Moodle on the JW FLV Player 5.0 with the FLV Player module wizard! ###

### Version 1.1 ###

The FLV Player provides an easy, reliable way for developers and non-developers alike (i.e. teachers, trainers and course content developers) to deploy a variety of different video formats as learning interactions in Moodle.

**Please note:** This module is now version 1.1. Although there may still be a few bugs the module is fully functioning. Please uninstall and delete any previous beta versions of the FLV Player Module before installing this first official public release version.


## Features: ##
  * Optional tutor notes which appear with video (new)
  * Video file types: flv, f4v, mov, mp3, mp4 or any media types supported by Flash Player 9.0.115+

  * Supports external, editable video captions - TimedText, SMIL, DFXP and Subrip (new)
  * A selection of 28 JW Player skins to modify appearance

  * User definable poster images

  * Specific controls over JW FLV Player behaviour (i.e. autoplay, fullscreen, start position, etc.)
  * Optional configuration of all features via external XML files so you can set course-wide FLV Player policies in a single XML file

## New features coming soon ##

There are two new features for the JW FLV Player that will soon be supported by the FLV Player module for Moodle:

  1. HD Video: Users can switch between normal and high-definition video streams
  1. Audio Description: Users can listen to an additional MP3 audio track synchronised with the video stream. This could be a narration, commentary or description for the visually impaired, sound effects or music.

At the moment, as of 13th January 2010, these two features have a few bugs and don't function as well as they should. I'm waiting for the developers at LongtailVideo.com to bring out new, fully functioning versions. Please be patient!

## Summary ##
The FLV Player plugin module is written in PHP. It leverages the very popular and widely used JW FLV Player and acts as a wizard for setting most of JW FLV Players parameters. The JW FLV Player is freeware but requires a small licence fee for commercial use.

I strongly recommend replacing the JW FLV Player in the /jw/ directory with the latest version from Longtail Video. This will include updates, improved features and resolved bug issues. Visit the [Longtail Video website](http://longtailvideo.com/) for more details.

[Moodle](http://moodle.org) is an open-source learning management system (LMS) or virtual learning environment (VLE).

Comments and suggestions for improving this module are welcome, as is any help with further developments.
